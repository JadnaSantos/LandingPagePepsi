## Project Description
<p aling="center">Well, I'm still getting started with programming. I spent a few minutes looking for interesting documents, videos and tutorials that would teach me how to develop something "simple" and complete. I found this tutorial on Youtube, and through that I managed to identify some functions and tag variables that I had been studying for some time.</p>
